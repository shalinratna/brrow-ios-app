---

## Flow 1: Authentication & Onboarding

### 1.1 User Registration
**File:** `Brrow/Views/LoginView.swift`

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Email/password registration with validation
- Google Sign-In integration (GoogleSignIn SDK)

- ⚠️ Google/Apple OAuth tokens need backend validation

**Analytics Tracking:** ✅
```swift
AnalyticsService.shared.trackAuth(action: "signup", method: "email")
```

---

### 1.2 User Login
**File:** `Brrow/Views/LoginView.swift`

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Email/password login
- OAuth login (Google, Apple)
- Session persistence
- JWT token management
- Two-factor authentication support

**Key Components:**
- `AuthManager.signIn()` - API call to `/api/auth/login`
- Token storage in Keychain
- User data caching

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ JWT refresh token logic may need verification
- ⚠️ Session expiration handling

**Analytics Tracking:** ✅
```swift
AnalyticsService.shared.trackAuth(action: "login", method: method)
```

---

## Flow 2: Listing Creation (For Sale)

### 2.1 Create For-Sale Listing
**File:** `Brrow/Views/EnhancedCreateListingView.swift`

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Multi-image upload (up to 10 images)
- Intelligent image processing (compression, orientation fix)
- Category selection
- Price input
- Location via MapKit
- Description with 500 char limit
- Cloudinary integration for image hosting

**Key Components:**
- `EnhancedCreateListingViewModel.createListing()` - Lines 200-350
- `IntelligentImageProcessor` - Compression & optimization
- `BatchUploadManager` - Parallel uploads with retry
- `IntelligentCacheManager` - Upload caching

**Data Flow:**
1. User selects images → `PhotosPicker`
2. Images processed → `IntelligentImageProcessor.processImages()`
3. Upload to Cloudinary → `BatchUploadManager.uploadBatch()`
4. Create listing → API `POST /api/listings`
5. Analytics tracking → `trackListingCreated()`

**Critical Fix Applied:** ✅
- **Bug:** All listings showed as "For Rent"
- **Fix:** `ModernListingDetailView.swift:889` - Changed `"FOR-SALE"` to `"sale"`
- **Verification:** `Listing.listingType` returns "sale" for purchases

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ Cloudinary credentials must be in backend env
- ⚠️ Backend endpoint `/api/listings` must handle category.name as String

**Analytics Tracking:** ✅
```swift
AnalyticsService.shared.trackListingCreated(
    listingId: listing.id,
    category: category.name,
    price: listing.price
)
```

---

### 2.2 Create For-Rent Listing
**File:** `Brrow/Views/EnhancedCreateListingView.swift`

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Daily rate pricing
- Rental duration options
- Same image upload flow as for-sale
- Availability calendar

**Key Difference:**
- Sets `dailyRate` property
- `Listing.listingType` computed property returns "rental"

**Verification:**
```swift
var listingType: String {
    if let dailyRate = dailyRate, dailyRate > 0 {
        return "rental"
    } else if price > 0 {
        return "sale"
    } else {
        return "free"
    }
}
```

- Listing info (price, location, description)
- Seller profile preview
- Message seller button
- Make offer button

    return listing.listingType.uppercased() == "FOR-SALE" || listing.listingType.isEmpty
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
private var isForSale: Bool {
    return listing.listingType == "sale"
}
```

**Display Logic:**
- For sale: Shows "Buy Now" button → Payment flow
- For rent: Shows "Rent" button → Rental options
- Shows correct pricing (`price` vs `dailyRate`)

**Analytics Tracking:** ✅
```swift
AnalyticsService.shared.trackListingView(
