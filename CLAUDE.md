- We are creating a master documentation book so keep all.MD files or any updated documentation information. Anything like that that we would need for a future Claude for myself or any future developers who come to work on this project is all going to be inside one file making it one massive thing and I know you cannot create a PDF file but there is already an existing PDF file. I do not want you to read because you will crash if you read that because there's too many pages so just keep everything clear and concise don't make a new MD files, split documentation appropriratelly.
- The Brrow ios application, should alwyas be archivable and the build should always succeed without errors, please check for this. Archive should never result in Generic Xcode Archive.
