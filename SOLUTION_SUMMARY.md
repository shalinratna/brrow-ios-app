# Archive Fix - Solution Summary

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Issue:** Xcode archives showed as "Generic Xcode Archive" instead of "iOS App Archive"

**Root Cause:** Archives missing `ApplicationProperties` dictionary in Info.plist

**Solution:** Run Script Build Phase that automatically adds ApplicationProperties

---

## Implementation Details

### What We Added

**1. Run Script Build Phase**
- **ID:** `AA419ADD4A281F99876E9CC1`
- **Name:** "Fix Archive Properties"
- **Location:** Last phase in Brrow target build phases
- **Execution:** Only during archive builds (`ACTION=install`)

**2. Script Logic**
```bash
if [ "$ACTION" = "install" ] && [ -n "$ARCHIVE_PATH" ]; then
    # Wait for archive to be written
    sleep 3

    # Add ApplicationProperties to archive Info.plist
    "$SRCROOT/add-archive-properties.sh" "$ARCHIVE_PATH"
fi
```

## How to Verify It Works

### Option 1: Quick Verification
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
./verify-archive-fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Test with Latest Archive
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
./test-archive-script.sh
```

### Option 3: Create New Archive
1. Open Xcode
2. Product → Archive
3. Check Xcode Organizer
4. Archive should show as "iOS App Archive" ✅
