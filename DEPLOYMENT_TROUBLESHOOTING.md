# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE
Railway deployment keeps failing with: `Cannot find module '/app/index.js'`

## Attempts Made (All Failed)
1. ‚úÖ Created production-server.ts with all endpoints
2. ‚úÖ Added TypeScript dependencies to production
3. ‚úÖ Created nixpacks.toml configuration
4. ‚úÖ Added Procfile
5. ‚úÖ Created start-production.sh script
6. ‚úÖ Simplified to minimal-server.ts
7. ‚úÖ Created Dockerfile
8. ‚úÖ Updated railway.json to use DOCKERFILE
9. ‚úÖ Added index.js fallback file
10. ‚ùå **All deployments still crash**

## Root Cause
Railway appears to be ignoring all configuration files and defaulting to looking for `/app/index.js`

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Railway Support (Recommended)
Contact Railway support with this issue. The deployment should work with any of our configurations but isn't.

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment Platforms
Consider deploying to:
- **Render.com** (similar to Railway)
- **Fly.io** (good for Node.js apps)
- **Heroku** (classic option)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

### Option 3: Manual Fix (Temporary)
Try creating a build that outputs to exactly what Railway expects:
```bash
# In package.json, add:
"scripts": {
  "railway-build": "tsc && cp dist/minimal-server.js index.js"
}
```

### Option 4: Use Different Project Structure
Restructure the project to have index.js at root that Railway expects:
```javascript
// index.js at root
require('ts-node/register');
require('./src/minimal-server.ts');
```

## What Works Locally
```bash
# All these work perfectly locally:
npm run start:prod
npx ts-node src/production-server.ts
npx ts-node src/minimal-server.ts
node dist/production-server.js
```

## Files Created for Deployment
- `/railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `/Dockerfile` - Docker configuration
- `/nixpacks.toml` - Nixpacks configuration (removed)
- `/Procfile` - Heroku-style configuration
- `/index.js` - Fallback entry point
- `/scripts/start-production.sh` - Start script

## Environment Variables (Confirmed Set)
- DATABASE_URL ‚úÖ
- JWT_SECRET ‚úÖ
- PORT ‚úÖ
- NODE_ENV ‚úÖ

## Next Steps for User

### If you want to continue with Railway:
1. Check Railway dashboard for any project settings that might be overriding our config
2. Try deleting and recreating the service
3. Contact Railway support

### If you want to switch platforms:
1. I recommend Render.com as the easiest alternative
2. The code is ready - just needs deployment
3. All endpoints are working locally

## Working Endpoints (When Deployed)
- `/health` - Health check
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- `/api/auth/login` - User login
- `/api/listings` - Listing CRUD
- `/api/categories` - Categories
- `/api/users/me` - User profile

## Test Commands (When Working)
```bash
# Health check
curl https://brrow-backend-nodejs-production.up.railway.app/health

# Categories
curl https://brrow-backend-nodejs-production.up.railway.app/api/categories

# Test endpoint
curl https://brrow-backend-nodejs-production.up.railway.app/api/test
```
