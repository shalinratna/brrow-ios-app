# Stripe Checkout Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented Stripe Checkout Session for streamlined guest payments in the Buy Now flow. Users without saved payment methods now get redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page instead of being forced to set up a payment method first.

## Implementation Date
October 7, 2025

---

## What Changed

### User Experience Before
1. User clicks "Buy Now"
2. Backend checks for saved payment method
3. If no payment method: Shows `PaymentMethodSetupView` (incomplete/placeholder)
4. User gets stuck - poor UX

### User Experience After
1. User clicks "Buy Now"
2. Backend creates purchase record
3. **If user has saved payment method:**
   - Creates PaymentIntent with saved method
   - Holds funds immediately (status: HELD)
   - Shows success message
4. **If user has NO saved payment method:**
   - Creates Stripe Checkout Session
   - Opens Stripe Checkout in Safari in-app browser
   - User enters card details on Stripe's secure page
   - After payment: Webhook updates purchase status
   - Returns to app automatically

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend Changes

#### **File: `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/brrow-backend/routes/purchases.js`**

**NEW ENDPOINT: Create Checkout Session**
```javascript
POST /api/purchases/create-checkout-session
```
- Creates Stripe Checkout Session for a specific purchase
- Requires authentication
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "listing_id": "string",
    "amount": number,
    "purchase_type": "BUY_NOW",
    "purchase_id": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "checkoutUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
    "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
    "expiresAt": 1234567890
  }
  ```

**MODIFIED ENDPOINT: Main Purchase Creation**
```javascript
POST /api/purchases
```
- Now creates Stripe Checkout Session automatically when `needsPaymentMethod: true`
- **Enhanced Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Purchase created - please complete checkout to finalize payment",
    "needsPaymentMethod": true,
    "checkoutUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
    "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
    "purchase": { ... }
  }
  ```

#### **Checkout Session Configuration**
- **Mode:** `payment` (one-time payment)
- **Payment Intent Capture Method:** `manual` (authorization hold)
- **Expiration:** 30 minutes
- **Success URL:** `brrow://payment/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&purchase_id={PURCHASE_ID}`
- **Cancel URL:** `brrow://payment/cancel?purchase_id={PURCHASE_ID}`
- **Metadata Tracking:**
  - `listing_id`
  - `buyer_id`
  - `seller_id`
  - `purchase_id`
  - `purchase_type`

#### **File: `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/brrow-backend/routes/payments.js`**

**NEW WEBHOOK HANDLERS:**

1. **`checkout.session.completed`**
   ```javascript
   case 'checkout.session.completed':
   ```
   - Triggered when user completes payment on Stripe Checkout
   - Updates purchase record with:
     - `payment_intent_id`: From session
     - `payment_status`: 'HELD' (funds authorized but not captured)
     - `metadata.checkout_session_id`: Session ID
     - `metadata.payment_status`: 'authorized'
   - **Critical:** Payment is authorized (held) but NOT captured yet
   - Funds remain in escrow until verification

2. **`checkout.session.expired`**
   ```javascript
   case 'checkout.session.expired':
   ```
   - Triggered when checkout session expires (30 min timeout)
   - Updates purchase:
     - `payment_status`: 'FAILED'
     - `metadata.payment_status`: 'expired'
     - `metadata.expired_at`: Timestamp
   - Listing availability should be restored (future enhancement)

### 2. iOS Changes

#### **File: `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/Brrow/Models/Purchase.swift`**

**UPDATED: CreatePurchaseResponse Model**
```swift
struct CreatePurchaseResponse: Codable {
    let success: Bool
    let purchase: Purchase
    let message: String?
    let needsPaymentMethod: Bool?  // Existing
    let checkoutUrl: String?       // NEW - Stripe Checkout URL
    let sessionId: String?         // NEW - Checkout Session ID
}
```

#### **File: `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/Brrow/Views/BuyNowConfirmationView.swift`**

**ADDED: SafariServices Import**
```swift
import SafariServices
```

**UPDATED: BuyNowViewModel**
```swift
class BuyNowViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var showCheckout = false      // NEW
    @Published var checkoutURL: URL?         // NEW
    // ... existing properties
}
```

**UPDATED: Purchase Confirmation Logic**
```swift
if response.needsPaymentMethod == true {
    if let checkoutUrlString = response.checkoutUrl,
       let checkoutURL = URL(string: checkoutUrlString) {
        // NEW: Open Stripe Checkout
        self?.checkoutURL = checkoutURL
        self?.showCheckout = true
    } else {
        // Fallback error handling
        self?.errorMessage = "Unable to process payment."
        self?.showErrorAlert = true
    }
}
```

**ADDED: SafariView for Stripe Checkout**
```swift
struct SafariView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    let url: URL

    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> SFSafariViewController {
        let config = SFSafariViewController.Configuration()
        config.entersReaderIfAvailable = false
        config.barCollapsingEnabled = true

        let safari = SFSafariViewController(url: url, configuration: config)
        safari.preferredControlTintColor = UIColor(Theme.Colors.primary)
        safari.preferredBarTintColor = UIColor(Theme.Colors.background)
        safari.dismissButtonStyle = .close

        return safari
    }
}
```

**UPDATED: View Presentation**
```swift
.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $viewModel.showCheckout) {
    if let checkoutURL = viewModel.checkoutURL {
        SafariView(url: checkoutURL)
            .ignoresSafeArea()
    }
}
```

## Stripe Checkout Session Configuration Details

### Session Parameters
```javascript
{
  customer: stripeCustomerId,           // Link to user's Stripe customer
  mode: 'payment',                      // One-time payment (not subscription)
  payment_method_types: ['card'],       // Accept credit/debit cards

  line_items: [{
    price_data: {
      currency: 'usd',
      product_data: {
        name: listing.title,            // Display listing name
        description: `Purchase of ${listing.title}`,
        metadata: { listing_id, purchase_id }
      },
      unit_amount: amountInCents        // Price in cents
    },
    quantity: 1
  }],

  payment_intent_data: {
    capture_method: 'manual',           // CRITICAL: Authorization only
    metadata: {
      listing_id,
      buyer_id,
      seller_id,
      purchase_type,
      purchase_id
    }
  },

  metadata: {                           // Session-level metadata
    listing_id,
    buyer_id,
    seller_id,
    purchase_id,
    purchase_type
  },

  success_url: 'brrow://payment/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&purchase_id=${purchase_id}',
  cancel_url: 'brrow://payment/cancel?purchase_id=${purchase_id}',
  expires_at: Date.now() + (30 * 60)   // 30 minutes
}
```

---

## Webhook Events

### checkout.session.completed
**Triggered:** When user completes payment on Stripe Checkout page

**Event Data:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'cs_test_...',
  object: 'checkout.session',
  payment_intent: 'pi_...',           // Payment Intent ID
  payment_status: 'paid',             // Payment authorized
  metadata: {
    listing_id: '...',
    buyer_id: '...',
    seller_id: '...',
    purchase_id: '...',               // CRITICAL: Links to purchase
    purchase_type: 'BUY_NOW'
  }
}
```

**Action Taken:**
1. Find purchase by `metadata.purchase_id`
2. Update purchase:
   - `payment_intent_id` = session.payment_intent
   - `payment_status` = 'HELD'
   - `metadata.checkout_session_id` = session.id
   - `metadata.payment_status` = 'authorized'

### checkout.session.expired
**Triggered:** When session expires without payment (30 min)

**Action Taken:**
1. Find purchase by `metadata.purchase_id`
2. Update purchase:
   - `payment_status` = 'FAILED'
   - `metadata.payment_status` = 'expired'
   - `metadata.expired_at` = timestamp

---

## Deep Link Handling

### Success URL
```
brrow://payment/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&purchase_id={PURCHASE_ID}
```

**Purpose:**
- Returns user to app after successful payment
- Provides session ID for verification
- Provides purchase ID to show relevant purchase status

### Cancel URL
```
brrow://payment/cancel?purchase_id={PURCHASE_ID}
```

**Purpose:**
- Returns user to app if they cancel checkout
- Provides purchase ID for cleanup/retry

**IMPORTANT:** Deep link handlers need to be implemented in:
- `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/Brrow/BrrowApp.swift`
- Handle URL scheme `brrow://`
- Parse payment success/cancel paths
- Update UI accordingly

---

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (Railway)
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...           # or sk_live_... for production
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...         # For webhook signature verification
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...         # Optional: For monitoring
```

### Stripe Configuration
1. **Enable Webhooks** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Add Webhook Endpoint:** `https://brrow-backend-nodejs-production.up.railway.app/api/payments/webhook`
3. **Select Events:**
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `checkout.session.expired`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`

---

## Stripe API Limitations & Best Practices

### Checkout Session Limitations
1. **Session Expiration:** 24 hours max, we use 30 minutes
2. **One-time Use:** Each session can only be completed once
3. **Payment Methods:** Limited to what you enable (`card` currently)
4. **Redirect URLs:** Must use HTTPS or custom URL schemes (brrow://)

### Payment Intent Authorization Hold
1. **Hold Duration:** Up to 7 days for cards
2. **Auto-Cancel:** Uncaptured authorizations auto-cancel after 7 days
3. **Capture:** Must call `capture()` before expiration
4. **Cancellation:** Can cancel anytime before capture

### Webhook Best Practices
1. **Verify Signature:** Always verify `stripe-signature` header
2. **Idempotency:** Handle duplicate webhook deliveries
3. **Quick Response:** Return 200 within 5 seconds
4. **Async Processing:** Process webhook data asynchronously
5. **Retry Logic:** Stripe retries failed webhooks for 3 days

### Rate Limits
- **API Calls:** 100 requests/second
- **Webhook Deliveries:** Unlimited (with exponential backoff on failures)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. **Implement Deep Link Handlers**
   - Handle `brrow://payment/success`
   - Handle `brrow://payment/cancel`
   - Navigate to appropriate screens
   - Update purchase status UI

2. **Add Loading States**
   - Show loading while creating checkout session
   - Show loading while opening Safari
   - Show loading during webhook processing

3. **Error Recovery**

   - Handle session expiration gracefully
   - Allow user to restart payment flow

4. **Analytics**
   - Track checkout session creation rate
   - Track completion rate
   - Track abandonment rate
   - Track time to completion

### Medium-term
1. **Apple Pay Integration**
   - Add Apple Pay as payment method type
   - Enable in Stripe Checkout: `payment_method_types: ['card', 'apple_pay']`
   - Better UX on iOS devices

2. **Save Payment Method After Checkout**
   - Offer to save card for future purchases
   - Use `setup_future_usage: 'off_session'` in payment_intent_data
   - Improve returning user experience

3. **Mobile-Optimized Checkout**
   - Use `client_reference_id` for additional tracking
   - Customize checkout appearance to match app theme
   - Add shipping address collection if needed

4. **Webhook Monitoring Dashboard**

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Deep Link Handler Yet**
   - Success/cancel URLs defined but handlers not implemented
   - User will see URL but won't navigate in-app
   - **Priority:** High - implement in next sprint

2. **No Session Cleanup on Cancel**
   - If user cancels checkout, purchase remains in PENDING
   - Should clean up or allow retry
   - **Priority:** Medium

3. **No UI Feedback During Webhook Processing**
   - User completes payment but doesn't see immediate confirmation
   - Webhook processing happens async
   - **Priority:** Medium - add polling or push notification

4. **Limited Error Messages**
   - Generic error messages shown to user
   - Could be more specific (card declined, network error, etc.)
   - **Priority:** Low

### iOS Specific
1. **SFSafariViewController Limitations**
   - Doesn't share cookies with main Safari app (iOS 11+)
   - User might need to re-enter autofilled card details
   - Can't customize toolbar beyond colors
   - **Workaround:** None - Stripe limitation

2. **Background App Refresh**
   - If app backgrounded during payment, might miss redirect
   - Need to handle app state restoration
   - **Priority:** Medium

### Backend Specific
1. **No Webhook Deduplication**
   - Same webhook could be processed multiple times
   - Could cause race conditions
   - **Priority:** High - implement idempotency keys

2. **No Webhook Retry on Failure**
   - If webhook processing fails, no automatic retry
   - Stripe will retry, but app should handle gracefully
   - **Priority:** Medium

---

## Security Considerations

### Payment Data
- ✅ **No card data touches our servers** - Stripe handles all PCI compliance
- ✅ **Webhook signature verification** - Prevents spoofed webhooks
- ✅ **HTTPS only** - All API calls encrypted
- ✅ **Authorization holds** - Funds not captured until verification

### User Data
- ✅ **Authenticated requests only** - JWT token required
- ✅ **Purchase ownership validation** - User can only access own purchases
- ✅ **Listing ownership check** - Can't buy own listings
- ⚠️ **Limited PII in metadata** - Only IDs, no names/emails in Stripe metadata

### App Security
- ⚠️ **Deep link validation needed** - Validate return URLs to prevent hijacking
- ⚠️ **SSL pinning recommended** - Prevent MITM attacks
- ✅ **Keychain storage** - Auth tokens stored securely

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment

2. Use real card (won't be charged due to manual capture)
3. Verify webhook deliveries in Stripe Dashboard
4. Monitor Discord notifications
5. Check Railway logs for errors
```

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Backend Logs
```bash
# Railway logs
railway logs --tail

# Look for these log patterns:
# ✅ "Checkout session created: cs_..."
# ✅ "Purchase ... updated with payment intent ..."
# ❌ "Error creating checkout session: ..."
# ❌ "Webhook signature verification failed"
```

### iOS Debugging
```swift
// Enable detailed logging
print("💳 [BUY NOW] Opening Stripe Checkout - URL: \(checkoutUrlString)")
print("✅ [BUY NOW] Purchase decoded successfully: \(response.purchase.id)")

// Check UserDefaults for any cached data
// Monitor network requests in Xcode console
```

### Stripe Dashboard
- **Payments > Checkout Sessions:** View all checkout sessions
- **Payments > Payment Intents:** See authorization holds
- **Developers > Webhooks:** Monitor webhook deliveries
- **Developers > Events:** Search for specific events
- **Developers > Logs:** API request logs

### Discord Notifications
All purchase events send Discord webhooks:
- 🔵 Blue: Purchase request started
- 🟢 Green: Purchase created successfully
- 🔴 Red: Purchase creation failed
- 💳 Purple: Checkout session created

---
