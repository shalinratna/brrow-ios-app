# Archive Fix - Quick Reference

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

### What Was Fixed
Archives from Xcode GUI (Product → Archive) now automatically show as "iOS App Archive" instead of "Generic Xcode Archive".

---

## How to Use

### Just archive normally:
1. Product → Archive in Xcode
2. Wait for completion
3. Archive appears correctly ✅

**No manual steps required!**

---

## Verification

### Quick Check
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
./verify-archive-fix.sh
```

### Test with Latest Archive
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
./test-archive-script.sh
```

### Manual Check
```bash
# Find latest archive
ls -t ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2025-*/*.xcarchive | head -1

# Check ApplicationProperties (replace path)
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print :ApplicationProperties" \
  "~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2025-10-16/Brrow-XXXX.xcarchive/Info.plist"
```

---

## How It Works

**Run Script Build Phase** added to Brrow target:
- Detects archive builds automatically
- Calls `add-archive-properties.sh`
- Adds ApplicationProperties to archive Info.plist
- Runs silently during normal builds

---

## Troubleshooting

### Archive shows as "Generic"?

1. **Check build log** (⌘9 in Xcode)
   - Look for "Fix Archive Properties" phase
   - Should see "✅ ApplicationProperties added successfully"

2. **Run fix manually**
   ```bash
   LATEST=$(ls -t ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2025-*/*.xcarchive | head -1)
   ./add-archive-properties.sh "$LATEST"
   ```

3. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   ./verify-archive-fix.sh
   ```

## Key Files

- `Brrow.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Contains Run Script Phase
- `add-archive-properties.sh` - Script that fixes archives
- `verify-archive-fix.sh` - Verify implementation
- `test-archive-script.sh` - Test with latest archive

---

## For Other Developers

**No setup needed!** The fix is in `project.pbxproj` and works automatically when they clone the repo.
