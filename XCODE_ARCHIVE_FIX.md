# Xcode Archive Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
When clicking **Product > Archive** in Xcode, nothing happened and Organizer did not open.

## Root Cause
The archive build was **failing silently** due to a compilation error in `MyPostsViewModel.swift`:
```
Value of type 'APIClient' has no member 'fetchMyListings'
```

## Fix Applied (Commit 5c652f6)
Updated `Brrow/ViewModels/MyPostsViewModel.swift`:

### Changes Made:
1. **Method name fix**: Changed `fetchMyListings()` to `fetchUserListings(status:)`
2. **UserPost initialization**: Fixed field mapping to match struct definition
3. **Category conversion**: Changed `listing.category` to `listing.category?.name`

### Before (broken):
```swift
let response = try await apiClient.fetchMyListings(status: "all")
```

### After (working):
```swift
let response = try await apiClient.fetchUserListings(status: "all")
```

## How to Archive Now

### Option 1: From Xcode GUI (Recommended)
1. In Xcode, ensure you're on the **Brrow** scheme (Product > Scheme > Brrow)
2. Select **Any iOS Device (arm64)** as your destination
3. Go to **Product > Archive**
4. Wait for the build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
5. Organizer will automatically open showing your archive ✅

### Option 2: From Command Line
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
xcodebuild -workspace Brrow.xcworkspace \
           -scheme Brrow \
           -configuration Release \
           -archivePath ~/Desktop/Brrow.xcarchive \
           archive
```

Then open Organizer manually:
```bash
open ~/Desktop/Brrow.xcarchive
```

Or use Xcode menu: **Window > Organizer**

## Verification Steps

### 1. Confirm Build Succeeds
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
xcodebuild -workspace Brrow.xcworkspace \
           -scheme Brrow \
           -configuration Release \
           -sdk iphoneos CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
           clean build 2>&1 | tail -5
```

You should see: `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`

### 2. Check Recent Archives
```bash
ls -lt ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/ 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Open Organizer to View Archives
- In Xcode: **Window > Organizer**
- Or press: **Shift + Cmd + Option + O**

## Xcode Settings Verified ✅

### Scheme Settings (Correct):
- **Archive Action**: `buildConfiguration = "Release"`
- **Reveal in Organizer**: `revealArchiveInOrganizer = "YES"` ✅
- **Post-Action Script**: Configured to add ApplicationProperties

### Recommended Xcode Behaviors:
Go to **Xcode > Settings > Behaviors > Build > Succeeds**:
- ✅ **Notify using bezel or system notification**
- Optional: Play sound (Sonumi)
- Optional: Speak announcement

## Post-Archive Actions

Once archive appears in Organizer, you can:
1. **Validate App**: Click "Validate App" to check for issues
2. **Distribute App**: Click "Distribute App" to upload to App Store Connect
3. **Export**: Export IPA for testing or ad-hoc distribution

## Troubleshooting

### If Organizer Still Doesn't Open:
1. Build the archive first (Product > Archive)
2. Manually open Organizer: **Window > Organizer**
3. Your archive should appear in the list

### If Archive Doesn't Appear in Organizer:
1. Check if archive was created:
   ```bash
   find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives -name "*.xcarchive" -mtime -1
   ```
2. Manually register archive:
   ```bash
   open "/path/to/your/archive.xcarchive"
   ```

### If Build Still Fails:
1. Clean Build Folder: **Product > Clean Build Folder** (Shift + Cmd + K)
2. Close Xcode
3. Delete DerivedData:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```
4. Reopen Xcode and try archiving again

## Current Build Number
- **Version**: 1.3.4
- **Build**: 606
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to archive

## Next Steps
1. Try **Product > Archive** in Xcode
2. Organizer should automatically open
3. Proceed with App Store distribution
