# Fixes Applied - October 14, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Email Verification 404 Error ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Clicking "Verify" button showed 404 error
**Root Cause**: iOS was caching the old 404 response from before backend fix was deployed
**Solution**: Added cache-busting policy to force fresh requests

**File Changed**: `Brrow/Services/APIClient.swift` (line 4856)
**Commit**: 440e73f "Fix: Email verification endpoint - bypass iOS cache to prevent 404"

**What was changed**:
```swift
request.cachePolicy = .reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData // Force bypass cache
```

This forces iOS to always fetch fresh responses instead of using cached 404.

### 2. Profile Picture Persistence ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Problem**: Profile pictures disappear after app restart
**Backend Fix**: Already deployed (commit 511be71)
**Status**: Backend correctly returns `profilePicture` field at version 1.3.4

**Verification**:
```bash
$ curl "https://brrow-backend-nodejs-production.up.railway.app/health"
{"version":"1.3.4","status":"healthy"}
```

The backend `/api/users/me` endpoint now maps:
```javascript
profilePicture: user.profile_picture_url, // Line 114 in routes/users.js
```

## üéØ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Rebuild the iOS App
```bash
cd /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow
open Brrow.xcodeproj
```

Then in Xcode:
1. Clean Build Folder: **‚åò + Shift + K**
2. Build: **‚åò + B**
3. Run on Simulator or Device: **‚åò + R**

### Step 2: Clear App Cache (Important!)
When the app opens:
1. **Force quit** the app completely (swipe up from app switcher)
2. **Reopen** the app
3. This ensures all old cached 404 responses are cleared

### Step 3: Test Email Verification
1. Go to your Profile
2. Click the orange "Verify" button
3. You should now see a success message instead of 404
4. Check your email for the verification link

### Step 4: Test Profile Picture
1. Upload a profile picture if you haven't
2. **Fully quit** the app (swipe up in app switcher)
3. **Reopen** the app
4. Your profile picture should still be there ‚úÖ

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Backend Version
```bash
curl -s "https://brrow-backend-nodejs-production.up.railway.app/health" | grep version
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

3. **Clear app cache** - Force quit and restart to clear old 404 responses
4. **Backend is correct** - All curl tests pass, issue was iOS caching

2. **Clear iOS cache manually**: Settings ‚Üí Clear Cache (if available)
3. **Delete and reinstall** the app (nuclear option)
4. **Check backend logs** in Railway dashboard
