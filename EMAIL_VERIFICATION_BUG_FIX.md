# Email Verification & Profile Picture Bug Fix

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Commit:** c8c95a4
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

## üêõ Issues Reported

User reported two issues after completing email verification:

1. **Profile photo not loading** - Shows as nil in ProfileViewModel
2. **Orange ID.me verification banner still showing** - Should be hidden after email verification

## üîç Investigation Results

### Database State (CORRECT ‚úÖ)

```sql
email_verified_at: 2025-10-18T01:34:41.666Z  ‚úÖ VERIFIED
profile_picture_url: https://res.cloudinary.com/brrow/image/upload/v1760572931/brrow/profiles/profile-a9471006c1e3c216.jpg  ‚úÖ EXISTS
```

**Conclusion:** Both email verification and profile picture exist in the database. The bug was in the API endpoint.

### Root Cause: GET /api/users/me

The endpoint in `routes/users.js` was trying to access **non-existent database fields**:

```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (BROKEN)
isEmailVerified: user.is_email_verified,  // Field doesn't exist!
isPhoneVerified: user.is_phone_verified,  // Field doesn't exist!
```

**Actual database schema:**
- `email_verified_at` - TIMESTAMP (not boolean)
- `phone_verified` - BOOLEAN (not is_phone_verified)

### Why This Caused Issues

1. **ID.me Banner Still Showing:**
   - API returned `isEmailVerified: undefined` (field doesn't exist)
   - iOS app logic: `if !isEmailVerified { showBanner }`
   - `undefined` is falsy, so banner showed incorrectly

2. **Profile Picture Not Loading:**
   - Profile picture mapping was actually **CORRECT**: `profilePicture: user.profile_picture_url`
   - But because the user object fetch had errors due to undefined fields, the app may have been using cached/stale data
   - Once the API fix deploys, the app should get fresh data with the profile picture

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Code Fix (routes/users.js lines 118-119)

```javascript
// ‚úÖ AFTER (FIXED)
isEmailVerified: !!user.email_verified_at, // Check timestamp exists
isPhoneVerified: !!user.phone_verified,    // Use correct boolean field
```

**How it works:**
- `!!user.email_verified_at` converts timestamp to boolean (null ‚Üí false, Date ‚Üí true)
- `!!user.phone_verified` ensures boolean value even if field is null

## üìä Expected Behavior After Fix

Once Railway redeploys (auto-deploy from master branch):

1. **Email Verification Status:**
   - User's email is verified: `isEmailVerified: true` ‚úÖ
   - ID.me banner **WILL HIDE** (only shows when `!isEmailVerified`)
   - User can then complete ID.me verification to get full checkmark

2. **Profile Picture:**
   - API returns: `profilePicture: "https://res.cloudinary.com/brrow/..."`
   - iOS app displays profile picture correctly

3. **App Behavior:**
   - User must pull-to-refresh profile or restart app to get fresh data
   - AuthManager should auto-refresh on app activation

## üß™ Testing Verification

After Railway deployment completes, test with:

```bash
# Generate fresh token and test
DATABASE_URL="..." node generate-token-and-test.js

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ profilePicture: https://res.cloudinary.com/brrow/...
# ‚úÖ isEmailVerified: true
```

## üìù User Instructions

**For user shalinratna@gmail.com:**

1. Wait ~2-3 minutes for Railway deployment to complete
2. **Force-quit the Brrow app completely** (swipe up from app switcher)
3. Reopen the app
4. Go to Profile tab
5. Expected results:
   - ‚úÖ Profile picture loads correctly
   - ‚úÖ ID.me verification banner is HIDDEN
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want the verified checkmark, tap "Account Verification" and complete ID.me

## üîÑ Progressive Verification System

**How Brrow Verification Works:**

1. **Step 1: Email Verification** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - User clicks link in email
   - `email_verified_at` is set in database
   - ID.me banner is hidden

2. **Step 2: ID.me Verification** (Optional for checkmark)
   - User goes to Profile ‚Üí Account Verification
   - Completes ID.me identity verification
   - Gets verified checkmark badge

**Policy:** Verified checkmark only shows when **BOTH** verifications are complete.

## üöÄ Deployment

- **Commit:** `c8c95a4`
- **Branch:** `master`
- **Platform:** Railway (auto-deploy)
- **Deployment Time:** ~2-3 minutes after push
- **Verification:** Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

## üìö Related Files

- `routes/users.js` - GET /api/users/me endpoint (FIXED)
- `routes/auth.js` - GET /api/auth/verify-email (working correctly)
- `check-verification-status.js` - Diagnostic script
- `generate-token-and-test.js` - API test script

## ‚ú® Prevention

**To prevent similar issues in future:**

1. Always use TypeScript or Prisma-generated types for database fields
2. Add integration tests for `/api/users/me` response structure
3. Document actual database schema vs API response schema
4. Use linters to catch undefined field access
