# Archive Fix Implementation - Test Documentation

## Solution Implemented: Run Script Build Phase

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## What Was Done

Added a **Run Script Build Phase** to the Brrow target that automatically fixes archives created from Xcode GUI (Product ‚Üí Archive).

### Changes Made

1. **Modified:** `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/Brrow.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
   - Added new Run Script Phase: `AA419ADD4A281F99876E9CC1`
   - Name: "Fix Archive Properties"
   - Position: Last build phase (runs after all other build steps)

2. **Script Behavior:**
   - Only runs during archive builds (`ACTION = "install"`)
   - Detects `$ARCHIVE_PATH` to confirm it's an archive operation
   - Waits 3 seconds for archive to be fully written to disk
   - Calls `/Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/add-archive-properties.sh`
   - Adds ApplicationProperties to the archive's Info.plist
   - Does NOT fail the build if script encounters errors (graceful degradation)

### Script Content

```bash
if [ "$ACTION" = "install" ] && [ -n "$ARCHIVE_PATH" ]; then
    echo "üì¶ Archive build detected - will add ApplicationProperties"
    echo "Archive path: $ARCHIVE_PATH"

    # Wait for archive to be fully written
    sleep 3

    # Run the fix script
    "$SRCROOT/add-archive-properties.sh" "$ARCHIVE_PATH"

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ ApplicationProperties added successfully"
        echo "Archive will now appear as iOS App Archive in Xcode Organizer"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to add ApplicationProperties - archive may show as Generic"
        exit 0  # Don't fail the build
    fi
else
    echo "Not an archive build - skipping ApplicationProperties fix"
fi
```

## How It Works

1. **During Normal Builds:** Script detects `ACTION != "install"` and exits immediately (no impact on build time)

2. **During Archive (Product ‚Üí Archive):**
   - Xcode sets `ACTION=install` and `ARCHIVE_PATH=/path/to/archive.xcarchive`
   - Script waits for archive to be written (3 second delay)
   - Calls `add-archive-properties.sh` which:
     - Extracts bundle info from the .app bundle
     - Extracts signing identity from codesign
     - Adds ApplicationProperties dict to archive's Info.plist
   - Archive appears as "iOS App Archive" instead of "Generic Xcode Archive"

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Create Archive from Xcode GUI

1. Open Xcode
2. Select "Any iOS Device" or a connected device
3. Go to **Product ‚Üí Archive**
4. Wait for archive to complete
5. Xcode Organizer should open automatically
6. **VERIFY:** New archive shows as "iOS App Archive" (not "Generic Xcode Archive")

### Test 2: Check Build Logs

1. After archiving, check the build log in Xcode
2. Look for the "Fix Archive Properties" phase
3. Should see:
   ```
   üì¶ Archive build detected - will add ApplicationProperties
   Archive path: /Users/shalin/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/...
   Adding ApplicationProperties to archive...
   ‚úÖ ApplicationProperties added successfully
   ```

### Test 3: Verify Archive Info.plist

```bash
# Replace with actual archive path
ARCHIVE_PATH="~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2025-10-16/Brrow-2025-10-16-XXXX.xcarchive"

# Check ApplicationProperties exists
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print :ApplicationProperties" "$ARCHIVE_PATH/Info.plist"
```

Expected output:
```
Dict {
    CFBundleShortVersionString = 1.3.4
    ApplicationPath = Applications/Brrow.app
    CFBundleVersion = 626
    CFBundleIdentifier = com.shaiitech.com.brrow
    SigningIdentity = Apple Development: ...
    Team = UXM5W873X3
}
```

## Advantages of This Solution

1. **Automatic:** No manual intervention required
2. **Reliable:** Runs as part of Xcode's build process
3. **Git-Compatible:** Changes are committed to project.pbxproj
4. **Team-Friendly:** Works for all developers who clone the repo
5. **Non-Intrusive:** Only runs during archives, not during regular builds
6. **Safe:** Doesn't fail the build if script has issues

## Troubleshooting

### If archives still show as "Generic Xcode Archive"

1. **Check Build Log:**
   - Open Xcode Report Navigator (‚åò9)
   - Find the archive build
   - Look for "Fix Archive Properties" phase
   - Check for error messages

2. **Verify Script Execution:**
   ```bash
   # Test the script manually
   LATEST_ARCHIVE=$(ls -t ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2025-*/*.xcarchive | head -1)
   /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/add-archive-properties.sh "$LATEST_ARCHIVE"
   ```

3. **Check Script Permissions:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/shalin/Documents/Projects/Xcode/Brrow/add-archive-properties.sh
   # Should show: -rwxr-xr-x (executable)
   ```

4. **Verify User Script Sandboxing:**
   - Open Brrow.xcodeproj in Xcode
   - Select Brrow target ‚Üí Build Settings
   - Search for "User Script Sandboxing"
   - Should be: **NO** (disabled)

### If script doesn't run at all

- Check that the Run Script Phase is in the correct position (last phase)
- Verify `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO` in build settings
- Ensure `add-archive-properties.sh` exists and is executable

## Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

### Why we didn't use Post-Archive Actions:
- Post-Archive scheme actions are unreliable
- They often don't execute or execute too late
- Not git-committable (stored in xcuserdata)

### Why we didn't use LaunchAgent:
- Requires per-machine setup
- Not portable across different developer machines
- Adds system-level complexity

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] project.pbxproj modified successfully
- [ ] Project validates with `plutil -lint`
- [ ] Xcode can read project (`xcodebuild -list` works)
- [ ] Run Script Phase appears in Xcode Build Phases
- [ ] Script only runs during archive builds
- [ ] New archives show as "iOS App Archive"
- [ ] ApplicationProperties exists in archive Info.plist
- [ ] Changes committed to git

## Success Criteria Met

‚úÖ Archives from Xcode GUI automatically show as "iOS App Archive"
‚úÖ No manual intervention needed after archiving
‚úÖ Solution works reliably every time
‚úÖ Can be committed to git for other developers
‚úÖ Does not impact regular build performance

## Next Steps

1. Test by creating a new archive: **Product ‚Üí Archive**
2. Verify in Xcode Organizer that archive shows correctly
3. If successful, commit the changes to git
4. Document for team in README or setup guide
