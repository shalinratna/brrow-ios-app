# Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Push Notifications - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## Overview

Push notifications with deep linking are now **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** for the Brrow iOS app. Users will receive push notifications on their devices even when the app is closed or backgrounded, and tapping notifications will navigate them directly to the relevant chat conversation.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. WebSocket Service FCM Integration ‚úÖ

**File**: `services/websocket.service.js`
**Changes**: Lines 6, 436-459

- ‚úÖ Replaced placeholder `sendPushNotification()` with real FCM implementation
- ‚úÖ Integrated with `notificationService.js` for actual push sending
- ‚úÖ Smart notification prevention (don't send if user is viewing chat)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error logging
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling (failures don't break message flow)

**Code**:
```javascript
// Import NotificationService
const notificationService = require('./notificationService');

// Send push notification via Firebase Cloud Messaging
async sendPushNotification(userId, notification) {
  try {
    console.log(`üì± [WebSocket] Sending push notification to user ${userId}:`, notification.title);

    // Check if user is currently viewing this chat (prevent duplicate notifications)
    if (notification.data?.chatId && this.isUserInChat(userId, notification.data.chatId)) {
      console.log(`‚úÖ [WebSocket] User ${userId} is viewing chat - skipping push notification`);
      return;
    }

    // Use NotificationService to send FCM push notification
    await notificationService.sendToUser(userId, {
      title: notification.title,
      body: notification.body,
      data: notification.data || {}
    });

    console.log(`‚úÖ [WebSocket] Push notification sent successfully to user ${userId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`‚ùå [WebSocket] Failed to send push notification to user ${userId}:`, error);
    // Don't throw - push notification failures shouldn't break the message flow
  }
}
```

**Commit**: `900cd01` - "Fix: Implement real FCM push notifications in WebSocket service"
**Deployed**: ‚úÖ Live on Railway

### 2. iOS FCM Token Registration ‚úÖ

**File**: `Brrow/App/AppDelegate.swift`
**Lines**: 44-46, 164-177, 248-271

**Already Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Firebase initialized on app launch (line 26)
- ‚úÖ FCM token fetching (line 249-271)
- ‚úÖ Token sent to backend via `APIClient.shared.registerDeviceToken()` (line 265)
- ‚úÖ Automatic token refresh handled (line 249)
- ‚úÖ APNS token registration (line 88-93)

**Backend Endpoint:**
- ‚úÖ `PUT /api/users/me/fcm-token` (prisma-server.js:9472)
- ‚úÖ Stores in `fcm_token` field with timestamp
- ‚úÖ Authenticated with JWT Bearer token

---

### 3. Deep Linking for Chat Notifications ‚úÖ

**File**: `Brrow/App/AppDelegate.swift`
**Lines**: 281-327

**Already Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Notification tap handling (line 281-327)
- ‚úÖ Extracts `chatId` from notification payload (line 303)
- ‚úÖ Posts `navigateToChat` notification to app (line 306-310)
- ‚úÖ 0.5 second delay prevents race conditions on cold start (line 288)
- ‚úÖ Also handles `purchaseId` and `listingId` deep links

**How It Works:**
1. User receives push notification with `chatId` in data payload
2. User taps notification
3. iOS calls `didReceive response` method
4. App extracts `chatId` from `userInfo`
5. Posts `NSNotification` with name `navigateToChat`
6. SwiftUI app listens for this notification and navigates to ChatDetailView

---

## How The Complete System Works

### Scenario: User A sends message to User B

#### Case 1: User B has app OPEN
1. ‚úÖ Message sent via WebSocket
2. ‚úÖ User B receives instant real-time update (WebSocket)
3. ‚úÖ NO push notification sent (user is viewing chat)

#### Case 2: User B has app CLOSED/BACKGROUNDED
1. ‚úÖ Message sent via WebSocket
2. ‚úÖ WebSocket detects User B is offline
3. ‚úÖ `sendPushNotification()` called with User B's userId
4. ‚úÖ NotificationService fetches User B's FCM token from database
5. ‚úÖ Firebase sends push notification to User B's device
6. ‚úÖ User B sees notification: "[User A]: Hello!"
7. ‚úÖ User B taps notification
8. ‚úÖ App launches and navigates directly to chat with User A

---

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Flow
```
Message Created
  ‚Üì
WebSocket Service: handleSendMessage()
  ‚Üì
For each offline participant:
  ‚Üì
sendPushNotification(userId, notification)
  ‚Üì
NotificationService.sendToUser(userId, payload)
  ‚Üì
1. Fetch user's FCM token from database
2. Check if push notifications enabled
3. Send via Firebase Admin SDK
  ‚Üì
Firebase Cloud Messaging
  ‚Üì
User's Device
```

### iOS Flow
```
App Launch
  ‚Üì
Firebase.configure()
  ‚Üì
Request notification permissions
  ‚Üì
FCM generates device token
  ‚Üì
Send token to backend: PUT /api/users/me/fcm-token
  ‚Üì
Backend stores in fcm_token field
```

### Deep Linking Flow
```
Push notification arrives with:
{
  "title": "John Doe",
  "body": "Hey! Are you free?",
  "data": {
    "chatId": "abc-123-def"
  }
}
  ‚Üì
User taps notification
  ‚Üì
didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse
  ‚Üì
Extract chatId from userInfo
  ‚Üì
Post NSNotification .navigateToChat with chatId
  ‚Üì
SwiftUI ContentView receives notification
  ‚Üì
Navigate to ChatDetailView(chatId: "abc-123-def")
```

## Notification Payload Format

### For Chat Messages
```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "John Doe",
    "body": "Hey! Are you free tomorrow?"
  },
  "data": {
    "chatId": "49c238ea-b8a8-4fe8-a40d-f1de905fd88e",
    "messageId": "msg-123",
    "type": "message"
  },
  "apns": {
    "payload": {
      "aps": {
        "sound": "default",
        "badge": 1,
        "contentAvailable": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Purchase Notifications
```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "New Sale!",
    "body": "@buyer purchased \"Vintage Camera\" for $150"
  },
  "data": {
    "purchaseId": "purchase-456",
    "listingId": "listing-789",
    "type": "purchase"
  }
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Firebase credentials not configured"
**Solution**: Add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to Railway environment variables

### Issue: "No FCM tokens for user"
**Solution**:
1. Check user logged in on iOS
2. Check notification permissions granted
3. Verify token registration endpoint is being called
4. Check database for fcm_token field

### Issue: "Push notification not received"
**Possible causes**:
1. User has push notifications disabled in preferences
2. FCM token is invalid/expired (iOS should auto-refresh)
3. Firebase credentials are invalid
4. iOS app not properly configured with GoogleService-Info.plist
5. Notification payload is malformed

### Issue: "Notification received but no deep linking"
**Solution**:
1. Check notification payload contains correct data fields
2. Verify `didReceive response` method is being called
3. Check SwiftUI view is listening for `navigateToChat` notification
4. Add logging to trace deep link flow

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Token Storage**: Tokens stored in database for persistence
2. **Multi-Device Support**: NotificationService supports multiple tokens per user
3. **Smart Notifications**: Don't send push if user is actively viewing chat
4. **Error Resilience**: Push failures don't break message sending
5. **Firebase Batching**: Uses Firebase's optimized delivery system

---

## Security

1. ‚úÖ JWT authentication required for token registration
2. ‚úÖ Tokens stored securely in database
3. ‚úÖ Firebase service account credentials in environment variables (not committed to git)
4. ‚úÖ FCM tokens encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
5. ‚úÖ User can disable push notifications in preferences

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Notification Settings UI**
   - Allow users to customize notification types
   - Quiet hours configuration
   - Per-chat notification preferences

2. **Rich Notifications**
   - Show message preview with sender avatar
   - Action buttons (Reply, Mark as Read)
   - Inline reply functionality

3. **Analytics**
   - Track notification delivery rates
   - Monitor token refresh rates
   - Measure notification engagement

4. **Additional Notification Types**
   - Listing expiring soon
   - New review received
   - Offer accepted/rejected
   - Payment completed

---

## Summary

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time messaging when app is open (WebSocket)
